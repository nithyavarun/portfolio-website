Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This simple yet effective website consists of two main pages: the Home page and the Contact page.

Home Page:
On the Home page, you'll find an introduction to who I am, my skills, and a showcase of my recent projects. The minimalist design ensures a clean and straightforward browsing experience, allowing visitors to focus on the content.

Contact Page:
The Contact page provides a convenient way for visitors to reach out to me. Whether you're interested in collaboration, have a question, or just want to say hello, feel free to drop me a message here.

Built with HTML and Basic CSS:
This website is built using HTML and basic CSS, demonstrating my proficiency in front-end web development. While it may be simple in design, it effectively communicates my skills and experiences to potential employers or collaborators.

Explore the website, and don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any inquiries or opportunities for collaboration!
